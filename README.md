# Weather Forecasting Model
 Deep Network LSTM model to predict the weather (Temperature and Humidity).

The dataset used for Training the model contains the Historical Hourly data of Delhi from 2009 to 2020 and was extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hiteshsoneji/historical-weather-data-for-indian-cities?select=delhi.csv). The Model is two-channel input and two-channel output for predicting the Temperature and Humidity.

The Model code is written in [MATLAB live Script](https://github.com/Manav321/Weather-Forecasting-Model/blob/main/WeatherForecasting.mlx).
